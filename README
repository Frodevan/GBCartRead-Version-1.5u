This is originally based on version 1.3 of GBCartRead from insidegadget.com (see https://www.insidegadgets.com/projects/gbcartread-gameboy-cart-reader/). The two folders contain an Arduino sketch for different purposes, one is for dealing with Gameboy cartridges, the other is a simplified version designed for dumping general purpose EPROMs and the like. Since it's an unofficial version, I decided to call it version 1.5u.

Significant changes from version 1.3:

	* Power to cartridge software-controllable
	* Code updated to Python 3
	* Way faster transfer rate
	* Support for GameBoy Camera

After some discussion with the original developer, most of these improvements were added to the official project.
